Simple, pluggable help-section/FAQs app.

Still very much in progress.

* Product backlog * 

* DONE extensible heirarchy of HelpCategories
* DONE 1..n HelpItems in each endpoint category
* DONE ordering, within categories and overall

* tagging for categories

* variable content of HelpItems - minimum is HTML, extend via either TinyMCE or other rich text plugin

* use tagging to suggest related topics
* get_related_items() method, returning other items in cateory and/or items with shared tags


Unit tests for:
* subcategory joining; recursion limits
* ordering
* searching
* tagging
(This is what I get for breaking my TDD approach...)

Views 
* DONE slug-based/SEO friendly help topics
* DONE category breakdown
* DONE per-category listings of all items in category
* DONE single item access, with link back to category

Search
* DONE sensible, scalable but database independent search
* DONE inclusion tag for searching help

* Ability for any user to rate usefulness (boolean) of help items 
  + use cookies to remember whether the user has rated this before
  + possibly track which authenticated users have marked this as useful

Cacheing
* add cache support
  + cache-buster, too, for when users rate something as being useful

Templates
* DONE simple out-of-the-box views and templates extending base.html
* AJAX-driven option too

Admin
* Better, less verbose list view pages
* DONE fix the order of fields to be more sane
